Networking basics
-------------------

#. IPv6 also **integrates** security and authentication into the basic protocol.

     To integrate is to make parts of something into a whole. It also means to become one unit, or to make a place (like
     a school) open to people of all races and ethnic groups.

#. As of March 2017, the fraction of **peers** using IPv6 to contact Google sites has risen to about 14% world-wide.

     A peer is someone at your own level. If you are a 10th grader, other high school students are your peers.

     Peer comes from the Latin par which means equal. When you are on par with someone, you are their peer. If kids your
     age are pressuring you to do something you don't want to do, that's peer pressure. In the sport of basketball,
     Michael Jordan was without peer, no one could equal his talent. When he switched to baseball, he found himself to
     be among peers again.

#. Those numbers look healthy, but in fact they're perhaps a bit **deceptive**.

     Something that's deceptive is not what it seems. A deceptive person will lead you to believe something other than
     the truth. Of course, I would never be deceptive when explaining the word deceptive.

     If someone tells you that "appearances can be deceptive," they mean you should look closely at your surrounding
     because the truth might not be obvious. You might see a connection between the verb to deceive and the adjective
     deceptive, so you are on to something. If you deceive someone, you are being deceptive. Is it ok to be deceptive
     when you are planning a surprise party?

#. Home and enterprise networks remain **overwhelmingly** centered on IPv4.

     In a way that is very great or very strong; In a way that is so powerful that you cannot resist it or decide how to
     react

#. Given that we've already lived through the IPv4 **apocalypse** and have used up all our IPv4 addresses, how is it
   that the world continues to rely predominantly on IPv4?

     Apocalypse is a word that means "the end of the world" -- or something so destructive it seems like the world has
     ended in a place, like a major earthquake.

     The apocalypse is the total destruction of the world, as prophesied in the biblical book of Revelation. Apocalypse
     can be used to describe utter destruction caused by war or natural disaster. The nuclear bomb attack on Hiroshima
     during World War II can be called an apocalypse because the devastation was so severe and so many lives were lost.

#. Given that we've already lived through the IPv4 apocalypse and have used up all our IPv4 addresses, how is it
   that the world continues to rely **predominantly** on IPv4?

     When the weather forecast says the day will be predominantly sunny, that means it will be mostly sunny.

     Use predominantly to describe the general, ruling quality of something, the same way you'd use the phrase "for the
     most part." An actor who is predominantly in films, appears mostly in movies, but might sometimes do live theater
     or TV. A neighborhood that is predominantly Indian has mostly Indian people living there, but maybe other groups
     too, in smaller numbers.

#. We could go on, but you get the **drift**.

     If you are get my drift, you get the basic meaning of what I'm saying. Or, if you move around without a seeming
     fixed destination, you are said to drift -- whether you're a snowflake or just a wanderer.

     Interestingly, the verb to drift can be used either approvingly or disapprovingly. We rather admire the freedom of
     certain objects that drift, such as snow drifts or drift wood, but applied to people we're a bit more critical: we
     tend to harbor suspicious of the carefree Gypsy or nomad, hence the moral criticism (and danger) inherent in the
     term drifters.

#. **Contention** for IPv4 addresses still exists, but like broadcast spectrum, it tends to be reallocated in economic
   rather than technological ways these days.

     There is nothing "content," or satisfying about being in contention, and that's probably because the word
     contention means being in a competition that ends with one side, usually the winning one, being content.

     "And in this corner, the contender" is heard at most boxing matches to describe each of the fighters about to go
     into contention it the ring. Sometimes, though, a contention can be a battle of words or a struggle between two
     parties over a single point. The expression "bone of contention" describes a narrow object of disagreement that
     reaches the level of strife, or contention. For two hungry dogs, though, the bone of contention might be a serious
     matter.

#. Contention for IPv4 addresses still exists, but like broadcast **spectrum**, it tends to be reallocated in economic
   rather than technological ways these days.

     A spectrum is a broad range of similar things or qualities, like the wide spectrum of political beliefs in this
     country, ranging anywhere from super conservative to uber-liberal and everything in between.

     Our modern definition of spectrum started out in the 1600s, when scientists used it to refer to the band of colors
     formed by a beam of light, like a rainbow. In physics, it's a word that describes the distribution of something,
     like energy or atomic particles. We still use those scientific meanings today, but spectrum can also apply to
     non-science related groupings or ranges of related things.

#. Contention for IPv4 addresses still exists, but like broadcast spectrum, it tends to be **reallocated** in economic
   rather than technological ways these days.

     To distribute something again is to reallocate. If one kindergarten classroom has too many crayons and another
     kindergarten class doesn't have enough, the school may want to reallocate the art supplies.

     If some resource needs to be handed out again in a different way, you'll have to reallocate it. Noticing that some
     of your party guests have two goody bags but several didn't even get one will inspire you to reallocate the party
     favors in a more fair way. Governments often find themselves in the position of having to reallocate money,
     resources, or services.

#. And yes, it is in some ways easier to **administer** than IPv4 and requires fewer hacks (e.g., less need for NAT).

     When you administer something, you give it to others. This can apply to a does of medicine, an order, a survey, or
     a punishment. Administer can also mean to run something -- such as a school or an office.

     The word administer belongs to a family of words, all having to do with being in charge: administration,
     administrator, and administrative. Strangely, administer comes from the Latin word minister meaning "servant." So,
     if you boss or principal administers an instruction that you disagree with, just think of that person as your
     servant. Doing so will help you carry out your duties with a smile.

#. The fact that you mush manage it alongside IPv4 **eliminates** any potential efficiency gain.

     As eliminate means "get rid of or do away with," it has become used to refer to the end of a problem or even an
     entire species. We need to eliminate sources of pollution in order to maintain a healthy world.

#. We've been publishing this book for a long time, and over the last few editions, IPv6 has always seed like it was one
   more update away from **meriting** coverage as a primary technology.

     Merit means "worthiness or excellence." If you receive a certificate of merit in school, you are being recognized
     for doing a good job. As a verb, merit means "deserve." Your certificate might merit a prominent place on your
     bulletin board.

     You will often hear the phrases merit-based promotion and merit-based pay, which come up when employees are pushing
     against a system in which time on the job -- and not job performance -- determines when works are promoted and how
     much they are paid. Using the word merit suggests impartiality and objectivity -- such as when you swear off a
     prejudiced approach to something and vow to "judge it on its merits."

#. 2017 Brings an **uncanny** sense of deja vu, with IPv6 looming ever brighter on the horizon but still solving no
   immediate problems and offering few specific incentives to convert.

     If something is uncanny, it is so mysterious, strange, or unfamiliar that it seems supernatural. If you hear
     strange music echoing through your attic, you might refer to it as positively uncanny.

     You can also use uncanny to refer to something that is so remarkable that it is beyond what is natural, as in "She
     has an uncanny ability to find her way around new places."

#. 2017 Brings an uncanny sense of deja vu, with IPv6 **looming** ever brighter on the horizon but still solving no
   immediate problems and offering few specific incentives to convert.

     Loom has two distinct meanings. First, a loom is a tool for weaving. Second, to loom is to appear or stand over
     someone in a threatening way. Don't loom over the person you're teaching to weave! You'll just make her nervous.

     The word loom, as an instrument to turn yarn into fabric, comes from Old English word for "tool." The verb form,
     meaning "to lurk just out of view," comes from Low German or Dutch. Anything that looms is coming into view slowly
     and isn't something you want to see. Although storm clouds and icebergs can loom, this word does not have to refer
     to a physical object. If a deadline looms, better get to work.

     looming on the horizon

#. 2017 brings an uncanny sense of deja ve, with IPv6 looming ever brighter on the horizon but still solving no
   immediate problems and offering few specific **incentives** to convert.

     If your mom wants you to mow the lawn but you don't feel like it, she might offer to treat you to ice cream after
     as in incentive. An incentive is something that stimulates you to take action or work harder.

#. 2017 brings an uncanny sense of deja vu, with IPv6 looming ever brighter on the horizon but still solving no
   immediate problems and offering few specific incentives to **convert**.

     Think of the word convert as meaning "change," whether it is a person who adopts a new belief, or a changing
     action, such as when you convert dollars into euros.

     Many times we can catch a words meaning by looking at its origins. In this case, the Latin can means "around,"
     while vertere means "turn." So we can fiture that convert means to "turn around," an objects or one's thoughts on
     an idea. For example, you might convert a meat eater into a vegetarian or an empty-nester might convert the kids'
     bedroom into an exercise room.

#. IPv6 is **superior** from an engineering standpoint.

     The salesman boasted to his customer that the $1 million car was well worth the price because it was far superior,
     meaning of high quality, to any car that had come before it. This car, the salesman bragged, could fly.

     Superior comes from the Latin word meaning above and literally means something that is above others in quality or
     status. Sometimes being superior can be perceived as a negative, as in the woman who acts superior to all of her
     friends, having a high opinion of herself just because she has millions of dollars in the bank after winning the
     lottery.

#. IPv6 is superior from an engineering **standpoint**.

     Your standpoint is the position, either physical or mental, from which your perceive things. From a practical
     standpoint, your parents might want you to study accounting -- but you're determined to follow your dream of
     becoming a professional mime.

     You can also call your standpoint your "point of view." From the standpoint of your position across the room, you
     can just barely see your friends watching a television soccer match and cheering on their favorite teams. From your
     standpoint as a basketball fan, you find soccer incredibly boring. It's the outlook you have on life or certain
     subjects that gives you this second kind of standpoint. The word comes directly from the German equivalent,
     Standpunkt.

#. You need to develop IPv6 **expertise** so that you're not caught flat-footed when the IPv6 rapture finally arrives.

     When you're an expert at something, you show expertise -- or an exceptional knowledge of the subject. "He had
     expertise in accounting, having excelled in math, but he had even more expertise in dancing, his hobby since a
     small child."

     Expertise has obvious roots in the word expert. Just about any interest or field has a place for experts. Just as
     one individual has expertise in world religions, another may have expertise in computer gaming. Working hard or
     immersing yourself in a specialty leads to expertise, and it comes through both study and hands-on experience.

#. You need to develop IPv6 expertise so that you're not caught **flat-footed** when the IPv6 rapture finally arrives.

     Not prepared for what is going to happen.

#. You need to develop IPv6 expertise so that you're not caught flag-footed when the IPv6 **rapture** finally arrives.

     Rapture is a feeling of emotional ecstasy so magical it's almost as if you've been transported to some other world.

     Coming to us from an old French word meaning "carried away," rapture certainly involves getting swept off
     Shangri-La. It's happiness so extreme that you just about float to heaven, complete with big goofy grin plastered
     to your face. Traditionally reserved for those feeling spiritual ecstasy, rapture now extends to anyone feeling
     overwhelmed by emotion -- sparked by everything from a passionate kiss to scoring an awesome dress on sale.

#. It's civic-minded, too -- your adoption of IPv6 **hastens** the day when IPv6 is all we have to deal with.

     The verb hasten means to move at a high speed. If you hasten to your room, no one will know that you came in late.

     Hasten comes from the word haste, which means "excessive speed or urgency." The words hurry and hasten are
     synonyms. Hasten can also mean "to make happen quickly," like when you open a window in the kitchen when you are
     cooking to hasten the room's cooling down. Hasten also means "to be quick," like when you hasten to tell everyone
     that the rumor going around about you isn't true.

#. In that case, it's your **solemn** duty to implement IPv6.

     If you've ever attended a funeral, you were probably struck by how quiet earnest, and solemn the mood was. You can
     use the word solemn to describe anything that's really serious and dignified.

     The adjective solemn comes from the Latin sollemnis, which means formal or ceremonial. You can still use it to
     describe a ceremony or event, but it's also a good word for talking about someone who's serious and sincere and
     maybe lacks a sense of humor about certain things. Here's a trick for remembering it: Think of a "sole man," a
     serious guy standing alone at a party talking to no one.

#. Don't **screw** things up for the reset of us by continuing to impede IPv6's adoption.

     screw somethings up = to spoil something by doing something stupid

#. Don't screw things up for the rest of us by continuing to **impede** IPv6's adoption.

     To impede something is to delay or block its progress or movement. Carrying six heavy bags will impede your
     progress if you're trying to walk across town in a hurry.

     Impede comes from the Latin impedire which literally means "to hold the feet," formed from the prefix in-, ("in")
     plus pes ("foot"). Think about walking with a cast on your foot -- how slow and awkward that would be. If you
     struggle with reading, that might impede your progress in your social studies class. An impediment is someghint
     that impedes, such as a physical defect that affects speech -- a speech impediment.

#. It's doubtful that you could not find any pieces of enterprise-grade networking **gear** that doesn't support IPv6
   these days but a lot of consumer-grade equipment remains IPv4-only.

     The noun gear refers to several things. First, it's the equipment we need for a sport or event. A gear is also a
     wheel with teeth that interlocks with another gear to transmit motion in a machine.

#. One of the main **chores** of the link layer is to add headers to packets and to put separators between them.

     A chore is a duty or task you're obligated to perform, often one that is unpleasant but necessary. Watching the
     dishes is a chore, and so is completing a homework assignment you aren't excited about.

     Sometimes a thing that you wanted to do can become a chore if it ceases to be fun or interesting. Maybe Napoleon
     felt conquering nations had become a chore by the time he was defeated in the Battle of Waterloo. The noun chore
     dates from the 18th century, when there were fewer appliances and more household tasks that needed to be done.

#. You might still run across **vestigial** references to framing choices in network documentation, but you can now
   ignore this issue.

     Vestigial describes an organ or body part that continues to exist without retaining its original function, such as
     our appendix.

     The adjective vestigial derives from the Latin word vestigium, meaning "footprint, trace." It's most often used in
     biology to describe something that either didn't finish developing or has become, through evolution, pretty much
     useless. An ostrich's wings are vestigial because it's unable to fly -- or do much of anything -- with them. A
     penguin's wings, on the other hand, are not vestigial because it has found another user for them -- to help it
     swim.

#. In this case, an Ipv4 router that forwards the packet onto the small-MTU network further subdivides the packet in a
   process called **fragmentation**.

     Fragmentation describes a separating of something into pieces. The way a family can be affected by divorce, its
     members living in separate houses, is one kind of fragmentation.

     People often have an image of an exploding bomb when they think about fragmentation, and that sense of something
     breaking into tiny particles is a useful way to think of the word, no matter how it's used. A burst water ballon
     experiences fragmentation, and so does a city disrupted by violence.

#. UDP is not so nice and is happy to **shunt** extra work to the IP layer.

     A shunt is a small tube that goes inside the body to drain fluid. It also means to divert in a general way, like if
     you shunt the thought of tubes in your body, you think about rainbows and kittens instead.

     Although shunt usually refers to a tube that drains blood or other fluid out of a part of the body, shunt also
     means to bypass. If a train is shunted, it's diverted from the main track onto a side track. The word may have come
     from shun, as in "turn away," which is what a shunt essentially does. It turns something away from where it was
     headed.

#. IPv4 fragmentation problems can be **insidious**.

     If something is slowly and secretly causing harm, it's insidious -- lke the rumors no one seems to listen to until
     suddenly someone's reputation is ruined.

     This is very fitting as an insidious rumor or problem is one whose negative effect is not realized until the damage
     is already done. Similarly, an insidious disease develops internally without symptoms, so that you don't realize
     right away that you are sick.
