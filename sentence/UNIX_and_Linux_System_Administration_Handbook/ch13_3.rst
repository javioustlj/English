Packet Addressing
=====================

1. The lowest level of addressing is **dictated** by network hardware.

     When you dictate something, you are giving orders -- acting a bit like a dictator.

     Dictate can be used in a broader sense. Weather often dictates how many layers of clothes you wear, and the school
     rules dictate how you behave in and out of class. In a very different meaning, dictate means to say something out
     loud to a person or into a machine so it can be recorded. Up until fairly recently, bosses dictated letters and
     reports to secretaries who wrote them down.

#. Sysadmins can sometimes identify the brand of machine that is **trashing** a network by looking up the 3-bytes
   identifier in a table of vendor IDs.

     Trash is rubbish or garbage -- it's the stuff that gets thrown away. Your town might organize a clean-up day each
     year when people pick up trash in parks and neighborhoods.

     Trash is dirty, worthless, leftover debris. Fittingly, the word is also a terribly derogatory term for useless,
     low-status people:"I should've known you were nothing but trash." And to trash talk is to brutally criticize or
     gossip about someone. You can even use trash as a verb, to mean "throw away," as in, "I'm going to trash this trash
     in that trash can over there."

#. **Spoofable** MAC addresses are also helpful if you need to infiltrate a wireless network that uses MAC-based access
   control.

     A spoof is a funny version of something, like a movie or a book. The classic comedy "Young Frankenstein" is a spoof
     of earlier, serious film adaptations of the famous novel.

     You can also call a spoof a parody. A spoof borrows material from the original, copying the style and
     characteristics that make it obvious what the subject of the spoof is. Movies like "Spaceballs," a spoof of the
     "Star Wars" films, and "Scary Movie," which spoofs the entire horror film genre, are great examples.

#. Spoofable MAC addresses are also helpful if you need to **infiltrate** a wireless network that uses MAC-based access
   control.

     If you infiltrate a group or organization, you join it in order to gain information, like an employee of a donut
     shop that infiltrates the competition to try to learn its "secret recipe" for its delicious dough.

     Infiltrate is a verb that is familiar to international spies and undercover agents, who are all adept at joining a
     group under false pretenses, fitting in, and working their way up to the highest ranks in order to find out as much
     information as they can about the group. The word can be used more broadly to describe anything that stealthily
     becomes a part of something else, such as slang words that infiltrate our everyday speech.

#. TCP and UDP extend IP address with a concept known as a port, a 16-bit number that **supplements** an IP address to
   specify a particular communication channel.

     A supplement is something added to something else. Nutritional supplements add vitamins and minerals to the ones
     already included in the food you eat.

     If a zombie army wants to increase its ranks but is running out of bodies, it might supplement its troops with
     mummies. If the zombies put out their manifesto and then realize they left out an important point, they might
     supplement the manifesto with a press release. That press release could also be referred to as a supplement.

#. The services file is part of the **infrastructure**.

     The infrastructure is the basic foundation or underlying framework of an organization or system. In your house, the
     infrastructure is the system of beams, weight bearing walls and the foundation that keeps it standing.

     Infrastructure often refers to the equipment and structures required by the military or by a country or region.
     Roads, bridges, and school buildings are part of our nation's infrastructure, and are necessary for the continued
     growth of our communities. This word was formed as a compound in English, using the prefix infra- "below,
     underneath."

#. To help prevent **impersonation** of system services, UNIX systems restrict programs from binding to port numbers
   under 1024 unless they are run as root or have an appropriate Linux capability.

     Impersonation is when someone pretends to be another person. If you pretend to be your twin brother all day at
     school, that's impersonation.

     There are a few different forms of impersonation -- some of them are harmless, like comedians who use impersonation
     to mimic the voices and mannerisms of famous people, or actors who play historical figures in movies. Other kinds
     of impersonation are harmful, including when a thief takes someone's indentity (including Social Security number
     and bank information) in order to steal their money.

#. Today, the privileged port system is much as a **nuisance** as it is a bulwark against malfeasance.

     Whether it's a mosquito or your little brother pestering you about the laundry, you can use the word nuisance to
     describe something that causes small annoyances.

     The noun nuisance traces back to the Latin word nocere, meaning "to harm." Nuisance originally was used to refer to
     things that could produce serious injury and harm, but over time the word lost some of its capacity for
     destruction. Nowadays you'll hear nuisance used to describe things or people that cause small problems or that
     bother you in annoying but trivial ways.

#. Today, the privileged port system is much as a nuisance as it is a **bulwark** against malfeasance.

     A bulwark is wall built for protection or defense. If you and your pals build a secret fort for girls only, you
     might want to build a bulwark to surround it -- with a "No Boys Allowed" sign posted prominently.

     A seawall that runs perpendicular to the shore is sometimes called a bulwark, because it defends the beach, not
     against invaders, but against beach erosion. Although the noun bulwark can refer to any fortified wall, it often
     specifically refers to an earthen wall, like a rampart. As a verb, bulwark means to fortify with a wall or to
     provide protection: "The volunteers used sandbags to bulwark the levee in an attempt to prevent the flooded river
     from overflowing its banks."

#. Today, the privileged port system is as much a nuisance as it is a bulwark against **malfeasance**.

     Whenever you see the prefix "mal-," you know it's not good. Malfeasance is bad behavior, especially from officials
     or people who should know better.

     If nothing else, the mal- in malfeasance will alert you to the fact that something bad is going on. If you know
     French, fease-, faise- will ring a bell, as it often means "to do." You can probably then infer that malfeasance
     means "to do bad." Today, it's usually a bad deed done by an official or an organization. You wouldn't accuse a dog
     who peed on the carpet of malfeasance, but you would accuse a mayor who took a bribe of malfeasance.

#. This practice limits the **proliferation** of unnecessary root privileges and adds an additional layer of abstraction
   to your infrastructure.

     Proliferation is a rapid multiplication of parts or the increase in the number of something. Nuclear proliferation
     is a rapid increase of nuclear weapons.

     The proliferation of any living thing will often create an overpopulation problem and cause an environmental
     imbalance. A proliferation of fuzzy koala bears might seem kind of nice, but these cute little creatures would soon
     eat up all the eucalyptus, running out of food and causing problems for other species. We almost always use this
     word to describe stuff we don't want to increase rapidly. The excessive proliferation of mutated cells, for
     instance, is how cancer grows.

#. The IP layer defines several broad types of address, some of which have direct **counterparts** at the link layer.

     If you leap tall buildings in a single bound for the Des Moines branch of your corporation, then your Metropolis
     counterpart might be Superman. That means you and Superman do similar jobs, but in different locations.

     The noun counterpart comes from the French word countre part, meaning "duplicate of a legal document." In legal
     circles counterpart still means "a duplicate document," but today it is more likely to describe people.
     Counterparts aren't duplicates, of course, but they have similar skills and responsibilities. If you play soccer,
     your counterpart is the player on the other team who plays the same position.

#. The **novelty** of anycast addressing is really just the relaxation of the traditional requirement that IP addresses
   identify unique destinations.

     Novelty is a newness or refreshing quality. Many college freshmen enjoy the novelty of living on their own — until
     it comes time to do that first load of laundry.

     You'll often hear people talk about the novelty of a new experience — imagine the excitement and anticipation of
     cracking open a novel you’ve never read before to help remember the word. But novelty is also a term for a small
     toy or trinket, usually mass-produced. Novelty shops sell all kinds of funny knickknacks, from personalized
     flashlight key chains to stuffed singing hamsters.
