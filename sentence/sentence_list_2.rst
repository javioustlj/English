1. Please **elaborate** issue and correction.

    Use the adjective *elaborate* when you want to describe how something is very detailed or especially complicated,
    like a devilish prank planned out weeks in advance.

    When used as verb, it means "add details, as to an account or idea; clarify the meaning of and discourse in a
    learned way, usually in a learned way, usually in writing."
