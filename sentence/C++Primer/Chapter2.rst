Chapter 2 Variables and basic types
====================================

1. Among the most fundamental of these common feature are built-in types such as integers, characters, and **forth**.

     *Forth* means "from now on." If you declare that from today forth, you'll pursue your dream of becoming a rodeo
     clown, it means you'll work everyday to make it happen.

     The adverb forth describes pushing forward, either literally or in time. When something goes *forth*, it moves into
     view or forward. In spring, flowers shoot *forth* from the ground. You have probably heard the expression and so
     forth, which like and so on means whatever else.

2. Using these facilities, programmers can shape the language to their own purposes without the language designers
   having to **anticipate** the programmer's need.

     To *anticipate* something is to be expecting it. Your dog might be waiting by the door, *anticipating* his next
     walk or squirrel chase.

     "Anticipating something" also often implies that you are preparing to take some action because of your
     expectations -- like when you anticipate your chess opponent's next move and plan a counterattack. The word
     *anticipate* also means "to come beforehand" -- as in a certain musical trend anticipating another.

3. As we'll see, defining our own types brings together all that we've learned before, because writing a class
   **entails** using the facilities covered in Part I.

     To *entil* is to involve. A job at a movie theater might *entil* sweeping popcorn off the floor, probably because
     watching a movie *entils* eating popcorn int the dark. It's small price to pay.

     The word *entil*, which comes from Latin, is connected to the idea of preconditions. If you want something, you
     better figure out what it entails. If it's only 8 o'clock and you want to see a movie at 9 o'clock, that will
     entail waiting for an hour. If you want to stay out of trouble, that will entail calling your parents and letting
     them know you're going to be late. That's what being responsible entails.

4. The standard doesn't define how signed types are represented, but does specify that the range should be **evenly**
   divided between positive and negative values.

     = in equal amounts or shares; in a balanced or impartial way.

5. The arithmetic types are defined to **cater** to the peculiarities of various kinds of hardware.

     To cater means to supply food for meetings or celebrations. If you're having a big barbecue party but would rather
     hang out with your friends than grill, you could pay someone to cater it.

     *Cater* has also come to mean "giving what is desired or needed." You might cater to your grandfather by bringing
     him tea, reading to him and laughing at his bad jokes.



6. The arithmetic types are defined to cater to the **peculiarities** of various kinds of hardware.

     Some characteristic or habit that's odd or distinctive is a peculiarity. Your brother's *peculiarities* might
     include always wearing a red knit hat, even in summer.

     A peculiarity is a quirk or strange feature. You might be self conscious about the fact that your ears are uneven,
     something you think of as an obvious peculiarity. Another kind of peculiarity is a quality that is specific to
     someone or something:"One peculiarity of people from the Midwest is that they call soda pop." This "special
     characteristics" meaning is the original one, which makes sense given the Latin root, peculiaris, "of one's own."

7. Accordingly, the number of arithmetic types in C++ can be **bewildering**.

     To *bewilder* is to amaze, baffle, dumbfound, flummox, perplex, or stupefy. When you *blwilder* people, you confuse
     them.

     *Bewilder* is a fun-sounding word for confusion-causing. A complicated math problem will *bewlider* many students.
     A magician's tricks should *bewilder* the audience. Mystery stories should be a little bewildering, at least until
     the end. Sometimes, being bewildered has a more emotional element. If someone you know died in a freak accident,
     that would *bewilder* you in a very sad way.

     *Belildering* means making you fell confused because there are too many things to choose from or because something
     is difficult to understand.

8. A few rules of **thumb** can be useful in deciding which type to use.

     = 大拇指

     A rule of thumb means a rough figure or method of doing or measuring something, usually based on past experience
     rather than on exact measurement.

9. ``float`` usually does not have enough precision, and the cost of double-precision calculations versus
   single-precision is **negligible**.

     When something is meaningless or insignificant because it is so little, it's *negligible*. The amount of interest
     you'll get on your savings is *negligible*, so you might as well spend your money.

#. Tracking down these sorts of problems in previously working programs is, **mildly** put, unpleasant.

     It means in a gentle manner or slightly;

     "to put it mildly" used to show that what you are talking about is more extreme, etc. than your words suggest

#. Floating-point literals include either a decimal point or an **exponent** specified using scientific notation.

     An *exponent* is a person who is a big promoter of something. Are you an *exponent* of the four-day school and work
     week?

     You may already know the mathematical meaning of *exponent*: a numeric notation showing how many times a number is
     multiplied by itself.

#. Two string literals that appear **adjacent** to one another and that are separated only by spaces, tabs, or newlines
   are concatenated into a single literal.

     *Adjacet* means close to or near something. You may consider the people up and down your street to be neighbors,
     but your next-door neighbor is the person who lives in the house or apartment *adjacent* to yours.

     *Adjacent* can refer to two things that touch each other or have the same wall or border. And the adjective is
     often followed by the preposition to: Her office is adjacent to mine.

#. C++ programmers tend to be **cavalier** in their use of the term object.

     Someone who is *cavalier* has a dismissive attitude and regards other people as inferior. If you think you know
     more than your teacher and never bother doing homework, your parents might complain that you are *cavalier* about
     your studies. 骑士

     If you have a *cavalier* attitude, you look down on other people -- as if you are sitting on a very tall horse and
     other people are sitting down there on the ground.

#. As presented here, the distinction might seem **trivial**.

     Something that is *trivial* is not important or significant, such as the trivial details you shared with me about
     your trip to the post office this morning.

     *Trivial* can also describe something that isn't deep or meaningful, like a *trivial* movie that you'll forget
     about after the credits roll.

#. As a **concrete** example, consider std::cout and std::cin.

     *Concrete* is that pourable mix of cement, water, sand and gravel that hardens into a super-strong building
     material.

     When used as an adjective, concrete also means solid. If you've got *concrete* plans for Saturday, then you have a
     definite plan.

#. Other times, the program completes but produces **erroneous** results.

     The adjective *erroneous* describes something or someone as mistaken and incorrect.

#. As we've seen, the type of an object **constrains** the operations that the object can perform.

     To *constrain* is to hold back, restrain, or confine. If you've ever had to constrain a toddler in the middle of a
     temper tantrum, you know you have to watch out for flailing limbs.

     *Constrain* can imply both literal and figurative bindings. You can constrain someone by physically holding on to
     something like a person's shirt. Or, you can figuratively constrain someone by putting up obstacles. Your
     teenagers, for example, may feel constrained by your rules and accuse you of sucking the fun out of their social
     lives.

#. Debugging problems due to pointer errors **bedevil** even experienced programmers.

     To *bedevil* is to "be" a bit like a "devil." To *bedevil* means to cause trouble, or, when talking about a person,
     to torment or harass.

#. Chapter 4 will show how we can **retrieve** the address stored in a void* pointer.

     When you *retrieve* something, you bring it back. Lots of dogs love to retrieve tennis balls, bringing them back to
     you over and over again.

     You might retrieve your cell phone from the car, or the toys a baby throws repeatedly on the floor. You can also
     retrieve a memory from the recesses of your mind, or struggle to remember someone's name and then suddenly retrieve
     it.

#. Whether a reference refers to a const or nonconst type affects what we can do with that reference, not whether we can
   **alter** the binding of the reference itself.

     After eating too many gingerbread cookies, she no longer fit into her uniform, so she had a seamstress *alter* it.
     It looked pretty much the same.

#. As a result, it is **immaterial** whether the object copied from or copied into is const.

     Things are *immaterial* have no physical form (like ghost) or are unimportant (like most ghost stories).

#. That is, they have forms that are tedious and **error-prone** to write.

     = capable of making an error

     If you're *prone* to doing something, it means you're likely to do it, have a habit of doing it, or are susceptible
     to it. People who are *prone* to getting the flu every winter should probably get a flu shot in the fall.

     The second meaning of *prone* is "lying face down," and the Latin root is pronare, "to bend forward." This is a
     handy way to remember both meaning: if you tend to wait to start your term paper until the night before it's due,
     you are prone to procrastination -- you bend toward it. If you stay up so late you fall asleep face down in the
     book, you are now prone at you desk.

#. It can be **tempting**, albeit incorrect, to interpret a declaration that uses a type alias by conceptually replacing
   the alias with its corresponding type.

     Anything that's *tempting* makes you excited or interested, like a tempting chocolate doughnut or tempting offer to
     go to the movies instead of doing your chores.

     An invitation or offer that intrigues you is tempting -- even it might ultimately be a bad idea. It's temping to
     skip school and spend the afternoon at the beach, but it's wiser to avoid the temptation. People commonly describe
     food they feel bad for them is tempting. This sense of something that's both harmful and attractive comes from the
     original meaning of tempt, "entice to evil or sin."

#. By **implication**, a variable that uses auto as its type specifier must have an initializer.

     An *implication* is something that suggested, or happens, indirectly. When you left the gate open and the dog
     escaped, you were guilty by *implication*.

     *Implication* has many different sense: Usually used in the plural, *implications* are effects or consequences that
     may happen in the future. You might ask,"What are the implications of our decision?" *Implication* is also the
     state of being implicated, or connected to something bad: "Are you surprised by their *implication* that you were
     involved in the crime?"

#. To avoid name **clashes** with other entities in our program, preprocessor variables usually are written in all
   uppercase.

     When two things *clash*, they run violently into each other, often with an accompanying loud noise. The
     percussionist in an orchestra has the enviable job of making two cymbals *clash* together.

     Kids *clash* when they run into each other on the playground, but they can also clash through a strong
     disagreement:"My cousins always *clash* when it comes to deciding what movie to watch after dinner." Also, your
     shirt might *clash* your pants, if the colors or prints simply don't go together. *Clash* is imitative -- it sounds
     like its original meaning, "make a loud, sharp sound," and may be related to the words clap and crash.
