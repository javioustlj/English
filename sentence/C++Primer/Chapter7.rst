1. The fundamental ideas behind classes are data abstraction and **encapsulation**.

    To *encapsulate* something is to sum it up in shorter form -- to summarize something.

#. In this case, the user is a programmer, not the **ultimate** user of the application.

    The last in a series can be described as the *ultimate*. A cheeky kid, when asked what she wants to be when she
    grows up, might say,"I want to be an actress, a singer, and a veterinarian, but my ultimate goal is to be
    President of the United States."

#. Similarly, good class designers pay **close** attention to the needs of the programmers who will use the class.

    The adjective "close" gives the sense of looking or listening even more carefully.

#. A well-designed class has an interface that is **intuitive** and easy to use and has an implementation that is efficient
   enough for its intended use.

    If you're *intuitive*, you can probably guess what this word means just by looking at it. No? Maybe you are not so
    *intuitive*, after all. *intuitive* means having the ability to understand or know something without any direct
    evidence or reasoning process.

#. Ordinarily, when we define a function that operates like a built-in operator, our function should **mimic** the
   behaviour of that operator.

    A *mimic* is someone who is good at imitating others. A gifted mimic might be able to imitate one president after
    another just by minimally changing facial expression and manner of speaking.

#. Class authors often define **auxiliary** functions, such as our add, read, and print functions.

    When you're offering something in support of an already existing thing, you're offering something *auxiliary*. The
    *auxiliay* police with things like directing traffic and crowd control when there's a special event in town.

#. Objects are destroyed when they **cease** to exist, such as when a local object is destroyed on exit from the block in
   which it was created.

    To *cease* is to stop or end. Your gym teacher may have trained the class so well that all chattering will cease
    every time she blows her whistle.

#. In particular, the synthesized version are unlikely to work correctly for classes that allocate resources that
   **reside** outside the class objects themselves.

    The place where you live---whether house, hotel, or mobile home---is where you *reside*. The president of the United
    States *resides* at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in a little shack called the White House.

#. If we don't define these operations, the compiler will **synthesize** them for us.

    When you *synthesize*, you combine two or more things to create something more complex. It's becoming more common
    for doctors these days to synthesize Eastern and Western approaches to medicine.

#. Our class is not yet encapsulated---users can reach inside a Sales_data object and **meddle** with its implementation.

    To *meddle* is to interfere. To meddle in someone else's affairs, and you can *meddle* with someone else's things.
    Either way, you're messing with someone else's stuff and she probably doesn't like it.

#. We also made another, more **subtle**, change: We used the class keyword rather than struct to open the class definition.

    Something that is *subtle* is not obvious: a professional food taster might be able to perceive subtle differences
    of flavor that most people don't notice.

#. This change is strictly **stylistic**; we can define a class type using either struct or class.

    stylistic = of or relating to style (especially in the use of language)
