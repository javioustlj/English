C++ Primer Chapter 1 Getting started
======================================

1. The data our program **manipulate** are stored in variables and every variable has a type.

     To *manipulate* something means to handle it skillfully, like the way a sculptor manipulates clay or really good
     politician works a crowd.

2. Many PC-based compilers are run from an integrated development environment (IDE) that **bundles** the compiler with
   build and analysis tool.

     A *bundle* is a package of things wrapped together. To wrap things together in a compact way is to *bundle* them.
     A baby wrapped up in a blanket is a *bundle* of joy, and if it's code outside, *bundle* up!

3. Fundamental to the ``iostream`` library are two types named ``istream`` and ``ostream``, which represent input and
   output streams, **respectively**.

     **Respectively** is used to indicate order, like if you said "Michael Phelps and Michael Jordan excelled in
     swimming and basketball, *respectively*."

4. Namespaces allow us to avoid inadvertent **collisions** between the name we define and uses of those same names
   inside a library.

     A *collision* is when two or more things smash together. You shouldn't give yourself a pedicure while driving
     because it might result in a *collision*, wrecking your car and spoiling your toenail polish to boot.

     When something happens by accident, it's *inadvertent*, or unintentional. The gas company assured you that the
     error in your bill was inadvertent and they would fix it, but not before you blew off some steam.

5. In this book, we **italicize** comments to make them stand out from the normal program text.

     When you *italicize* your writing, you print or type in the slanted letters called "italics". You can italicize a
     word in a sentence when you want to emphasize it.

6. In actual program, whether comment text is distinguished from the text used for program code depending on the
   **sophistication** of the programming environment you are using.

     *Sophistication* is the quality that belongs to a person who appears wise and glamorous. Sipping tea and
     appreciating opera are both stereotypical signs of *sophistication*.

7. Statements normally execute **sequentially**.

     It means in a consecutive manner.

8. Sum of 1 to 10 **inclusive** is 55.

     Call something *inclusive* when it's designed or inclined to include. An exclusive club might let you in, but an
     inclusive one will ask you to join, no string attached.

9. To **recap**, the overall execution flow of this ``for`` is as below.

     To *recap* is to briefly explain something by giving just the main points or details. You might write a popular
     blog in which you *recap* episodes of your favorite TV shows.

10. We can use an ``if`` to write a program to count how many **consecutive** times each distinct value appears in the
    input.

      If things are *consecutive*, they happen one after the other with no break. If there are five *consecutive*
      snowstorms on five *consecutive* days, you'll have to shovel your way out on day six.

11. Often a single error can have a **cascading** effect and cause a compiler to report more errors than actually are
    present.

      In this sentence, it means arrange (a number of devices or objects) in a series or sequence.
      级联

12. Like a ``while``, an ``if`` **evaluates** a condition.

      When you *evaluate* something, you're making a judgment, one that most likely results from some degree of
      analysis.
