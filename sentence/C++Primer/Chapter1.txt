manipulate	The data our program manipulate are stored in variables and every variable has a type.	To manipulate something means to handle it skillfully, like the way a sculptor manipulates clay or really good politician works a crowd.	C++ Primer Chapter 1 Getting started
bundle	Many PC-based compilers are run from an integrated development environment (IDE) that bundles the compiler with build and analysis tool.	A bundle is a package of things wrapped together. To wrap things together in a compact way is to bundle them. A baby wrapped up in a blanket is a bundle of joy, and if it's code outside, bundle up!	C++ Primer Chapter 1 Getting started
respectively	Fundamental to the ``iostream`` library are two types named ``istream`` and ``ostream``, which represent input and output streams, respectively.	Respectively is used to indicate order, like if you said "Michael Phelps and Michael Jordan excelled in swimming and basketball, respectively."	C++ Primer Chapter 1 Getting started
collision	Namespaces allow us to avoid inadvertent collisions between the name we define and uses of those same names inside a library.	A collision is when two or more things smash together. You shouldn't give yourself a pedicure while driving because it might result in a collision, wrecking your car and spoiling your toenail polish to boot.<br>When something happens by accident, it's inadvertent, or unintentional. The gas company assured you that the error in your bill was inadvertent and they would fix it, but not before you blew off some steam.	C++ Primer Chapter 1 Getting started
italicize	In this book, we italicize comments to make them stand out from the normal program text.	When you italicize your writing, you print or type in the slanted letters called "italics". You can italicize a word in a sentence when you want to emphasize it.	C++ Primer Chapter 1 Getting started
sophistication	In actual program, whether comment text is distinguished from the text used for program code depending on the sophistication of the programming environment you are using.	Sophistication is the quality that belongs to a person who appears wise and glamorous. Sipping tea and appreciating opera are both stereotypical signs of sophistication.	C++ Primer Chapter 1 Getting started
sequentially	Statements normally execute sequentially.	It means in a consecutive manner.	C++ Primer Chapter 1 Getting started
inclusive	Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is 55.	Call something inclusive when it's designed or inclined to include. An exclusive club might let you in, but an inclusive one will ask you to join, no string attached.	C++ Primer Chapter 1 Getting started
recap	To recap, the overall execution flow of this ``for`` is as below.	To recap is to briefly explain something by giving just the main points or details. You might write a popular blog in which you recap episodes of your favorite TV shows.	C++ Primer Chapter 1 Getting started
consecutive	We can use an ``if`` to write a program to count how many consecutive times each distinct value appears in the input.	If things are consecutive, they happen one after the other with no break. If there are five consecutive snowstorms on five consecutive days, you'll have to shovel your way out on day six.	C++ Primer Chapter 1 Getting started
cascade	Often a single error can have a cascading effect and cause a compiler to report more errors than actually are present.	In this sentence, it means arrange (a number of devices or objects) in a series or sequence. 级联	C++ Primer Chapter 1 Getting started
evaluate	Like a ``while``, an ``if`` evaluates a condition.	When you evaluate something, you're making a judgment, one that most likely results from some degree of analysis.	C++ Primer Chapter 1 Getting started
