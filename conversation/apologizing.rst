Apologizing
===============

::

    Oh, I'm so sorry. I should have been looking where I was going. Are you all right?
    Yeah, don't worry about it.
    But you spilled some coffee. Can I get you another one?
    No, it's fine, really.


- I'm sorry I'm so late.
- I'm terribly sorry I forgot to tell you.
- I'm very sorry I didn't bring your book.
- I do apologize. I'll get you another cup.
- I must apologize for keeping you waiting.
- We would like to apologize on behalf of the management.
- We would like to offer our apologies for the inconvenience.
- Please accept our apologies for not responding sooner.

- That's all right.
- That's OK.
- No problem.
- Don't worry about it.
- It's fine, really.
