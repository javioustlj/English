Asking for clarification
==============================

::

    - It says in the box take two tablets in the morning and in the evening? That's confusing. Do they mean four a day?
    - I'm sorry, what are you exactly asking?
    - I mean, is it two in the morning and then two int the evening?
    - Oh I see, um, I don't know exactly.

- I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand.
- Would you mind explain that again? I'm not sure that I've understood correctly.
- Sorry, I don't quite follow you.
- Can I just check that I've got this right?
- I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do.
- I'm not exactly clear about what you are saying.
- I'm not really sure what you mean.
- Sorry, could you repeat that? I didn't hear what you said.
- Sorry, would you mind repeating what you just said?
- If I understand you correctly, you want me to phone the customer and apologise?
- Do you mean to say that the deals off?
- What exactly are you saying?
- So you are saying that the meeting's canceled?
- Sorry, did you mean that I should wait here or come back later?
- Can you just confirm your date of birth for me, please?


- I mean that it is too late to change the deadline.
- What I mean is you need to press both keys at the same time.
