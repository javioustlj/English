Asking about obligation
=========================

::

    - Do I have to wear this visitor badge even here in the cafeteria?
    - Yes, I think so.
    - And am I suppose to turn it in at the security desk if I run out for a sandwich?
    - No, just turn it in at the end of the day.

- What time do we have to be home?
- Are we supposed to show our ID cards?
- Is it necessary to apply for a visa?
- Is there a legal obligation to wear a bike helmet here?
